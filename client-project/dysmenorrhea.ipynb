        "\n",
        "- Most questions were asked in 2010 and 2011 (184,312 and 205,417, respectively). Fewest questions were asked in 2009. It may be explained by the popularity of ChaCha website. The period of 2010 - 2011 was the most prosperous time of ChaCha. In 2010, ChaCha Inc. was recognized as one of the \"Hottest Companies in the Midwest\" by Lead411.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Top 5 ages that asked most questions are 15, 16, 17, 14 and 19. They were all teenagers. All girls started having their first menstruation during their teenage age. That can explain why they had a lot of questions and prefered to use this platform to ask to avoid embarassment.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Top 5 states that had the most number of questions are California, Indiana, Ohio, Missouri, and Texas. California is the most populous state in the US, Indiana is where ChaCha Inc. was founded, Ohio and Missouri are in midwest area. All these can explain why ChaCha was popular among people from these states.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### In the second methodology, there are some insights we got from our analysis:####\n",
        "\n",
        "- The most bursting words in the queries asked by Male are about dysmenorrhea symptoms and medication for cramps. This can be explained as the Men are mostly in caregiver role with regards to this health condition.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Top 30 bursting words are seen a lot in 2009 (the first year of all collected questions). Their frequency reduced subsequantly the following years. That is probably because the users were able to search for the same questions in the platform before they posted theirs.\n",
        "\n",
        "- \"cure\" and \"preg\" were the most used, in the queries asked by Female. It can be explained that when asking about menstrual pain, women most likely seeked a way to cure it in the early ages and cramp is highly associated with pregnancy.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The bursting words asked by women are weighted double more than those words asked by men. It is probably because there were a lot more women asking the same questions than men.\n",

        "##### Observations\n",
        "Analysis of postings grouped by year, month, season, day, and day of week provided a few noteworthy insights. \n",
        "First, while the number of postings per year may be related to the popularity of the now defunct website (Chacha.com) at the time, the higher than average number of postings during the summer months (see Fig2) may indicate that warmer temperatures combined with menstral cramps increase a subjects' percieved discomfort. Second, there seems to be a small uptick in the number of postings on the 12th of each month. Further analysis is required to understand if this is an outlier or within standard deviation. Finally, it was observed that the fewest postings occured on Thursday and Friday - this may be largely socio-cultural as the majority of subjects live in the US, and those days are popular for social activities.
